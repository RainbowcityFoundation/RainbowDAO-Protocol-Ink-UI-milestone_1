Don\r\n              Alejandro of Guatemala announced an exciting news: Rainbow warrior is about to turn up.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The story of rainbow\r\n              warrior dates back to another ancient Mayan prophecy passed down from generation to generation.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              It says that\r\n              humans with light skin will land the east coast of America to conquer the Indians. Unfortunately, there's\r\n              simply nothing they can do to stop these greedy predators.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              But at this time, the dawn is breaking on the\r\n              horizon of the East and the Indians regain strength, self-esteem and wisdom.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Together with throngs of\r\n              light-skinned friends, they begin to devote themselves to the improvement of the earth under the leadership of\r\n              rainbow, mankind of all races and all religions collaborate to spread the concept that humans should live in\r\n              harmony with nature. Anyone equipped with the concept will be called as “rainbow warrior”.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Warriors as they\r\n              are, they won't hurt others since inherits the wisdom and benevolence from their ancestors.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Praising virtue\r\n              and punishing vice through the fierce non-violent struggle, they prevent the destruction and disintegration of\r\n              the earth ultimately and bring the world peace, prosperity and a new belief.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The above is the Rainbow Warrior\r\n              part in the Mayan prophecy and exactly the belief and mission of Rainbow Warrior of Rainbow City, the prophecy\r\n              in Bible about doomsday and New Jerusalem.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              After thousands of years of evolution, human civilization is facing\r\n              division and collapse. In 2009, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, which opened a new era, and\r\n              human civilization began to enter the \"digital Bitcoin era\".\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              In this great era of civilization enhancement, a\r\n              group of Satoshi Nakamoto's believers made up their mind to re-establish the rainbow contract with God and\r\n              recreate the Tower of Babel, namely, Rainbow City. This time we plan to have Satoshi Nakamoto's name up, the\r\n              Creator of the Bitcoin world, not human beings'.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We want to make another contract with God in the name of\r\n              \"Rainbow\", and the \"Rainbow City\" we created is a Bitcoin civilized digital city-state based on \"Token\r\n              Economy\" and \"Community Governance\". In the system of \"Rainbow City\", we will issue \"Rainbow Token-RBT\", and\r\n              community members who have \"Rainbow Token-RBT\" will all be called \"Rainbow Warriors\". The \"Rainbow Warriors\"\r\n              defend the consensus that man and nature live in harmony. This is the Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin consensus!\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Under the leadership of \"Rainbow\", different beliefs and races will unite to spread the concept that human\r\n              beings should live in harmony with nature. Anyone with this consciousness can become a \"Rainbow Warrior\" who\r\n              are able to resonate with the consciousness of the universe,and promote the earth’s civilization into the\r\n              dimension of time.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport pageFooter from \"@/components/pageFooter\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"rainbowWarriorPage\",\r\n  components: {pageFooter},\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      activeIndex: 0\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n.rainbow-warrior {\r\n  background: url(\"../../assets/imgs/isLand_bg.png\") no-repeat !important;\r\n  background-size: 100% auto!important;\r\n\r\n  .title {\r\n    height: 190px;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n\r\n    img {\r\n      margin-top: 30px;\r\n      width: 500px;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .warrior-nav {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    height: 90px;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    justify-content: center;\r\n\r\n    .nav-item {\r\n      cursor: pointer;\r\n      padding: 30px 30px 40px;\r\n      height: 34px;\r\n      font-size: 16px;\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n      text-align: left;\r\n      color: #666666;\r\n      line-height: 34px;\r\n      border-bottom: 1px solid #eaeaea;\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      &.active {\r\n        color: #db1f7e !important;\r\n        &:after{\r\n          content: '';\r\n          width: 100px;\r\n          height: 1px;\r\n          position: absolute;\r\n          background: #DB1F7E;\r\n          bottom: 0;\r\n          left: calc(50% - 50px);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  .table-title{\r\n    height: 100px!important;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./rainbowWarriorPage.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./rainbowWarriorPage.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./rainbowWarriorPage.vue?vue&type=template&id=07fa41a5&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./rainbowWarriorPage.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./rainbowWarriorPage.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./rainbowWarriorPage.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=07fa41a5&lang=scss&scoped=true&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"07fa41a5\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports"],"sourceRoot":""}
